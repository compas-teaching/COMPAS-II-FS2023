# Assignment 01

#Project box to xy-plane:
#
#* Create a box at a certain location with a certain orientation.
#* Create a Projection (can be orthogonal, parallel or perspective)
#* Convert the box to a mesh and project the it onto the xy-plane.
#* Use artists to draw the result

## How to start
#
#Use the following code as a starting point for your assignment:
#
#```python
